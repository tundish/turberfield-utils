Turberfield's mission is to provide a validated Pythonic framework for discrete
event simulations and turn-based games.

The API may change significantly as the project proceeds. At this early stage,
you should only use the latest release, which may not be compatible with
previous versions.

If you've spotted a bug in Turberfield, please let me know so I can fix it.
If you think Turberfield lacks a feature, you can help drive development by
describing your Use Case.

In either event, please leave a message on the project's `message board`_.
