Turberfield Utilities
=====================

Turberfield's mission is to provide a validated Pythonic framework for discrete
event simulations and turn-based games.

The API may change significantly as the project proceeds. At this early stage,
you should only use the latest release, which may not be compatible with
previous versions.
