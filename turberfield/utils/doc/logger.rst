Flexible logging
================

Python's standard `logging module`_ was conceived some time ago. It can be difficult
to configure and it lacks the ability to easily communicate structured data.

The Turberfield :py:mod:`logger <turberfield.utils.utils.logger>` module is designed
for use in both web-native applications and offline tooling.

It is flexible and easily customisable.
